NYPD Disc-Tracker
=====

This web app is written for NYPD, Columbia University's women's ultimate frisbee team, to keep track of team disc time over the summer.

It will allow individual users to input their disc time each day, and also display a graph of all players and their daily disc times in comparison with their teammates.

The graphing aspect of this web app is written in Javascript using D3.js and uses colors from Colorbrewer developed by Cynthia Brewer.
