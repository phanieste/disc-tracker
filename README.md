NYPD Disc-Tracker
=====

This web app is written for NYPD, Columbia University's women's ultimate frisbee team, to keep track of team disc time over the summer.

It will allow individual users to input their disc time each day, and also display a graph of all players and their daily disc times in comparison with their teammates.

This web app is written using Python Flask and the graphing aspect is handled by Bokeh using color specifications and designs developed by Cynthia Brewer (http://colorbrewer.org).
